Hack/Reduce 1: Looking at Bristol through Data
==============================================
*15th/16th February 2013*

## What we made ##

We made these (and more) tools, visualizations and other things at the first SW Hack/Reduce event. Most are works in progress. If you made something at the event, or have since updated or improved something we made, please let us know.

### Bristol Data as JSON code ###

By Duncan Wilkie

### Word frequencies in historic Bristol obituaries ###

We tackled this from a couple of angles.

Firstly, this Javascript code by Mark Heseltine produces a word cloud visualization. Users can select the month and year of the source texts interactively. Licensed as open source under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

Chris Bailey's pair of Python scripts, ''mapper.py'' and ''reducer.py'' [(in the literary-obituaries directory of this repository)](https://github.com/paulharwood/swbd/tree/master/literary-obituaries) can be used as a Mapper and Reducer in Hadoop to count word frequencies in the body of the articles, omitting the metadata. ''scrape_obituaries.py'' (in the same place) can be used to obtain a similar corpus of obituaries from a 21st century newspaper website, which you can compare with the historical data.
